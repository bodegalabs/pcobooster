/**
 * Publishes one prepared iOS update into the application stack's update bucket
 * (`apps/server/src/mobile-update-bucket.ts`). `bun run ios:update` prepares and signs the release,
 * then deploys this stack with the operator's Alchemy login; never run it by hand. It stores every
 * file not already stored, after checking its bytes still hash to what was signed, and then, last,
 * the answer phones of the runtime version get. The API Worker serves that answer as soon as it is
 * written. Redeploying the same release changes nothing.
