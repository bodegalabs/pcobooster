/**
 * The product API: one group per namespace, every path under `/api/v1`. The server serves
 * `ProductApi`; clients are built from `ProductWireApi`, whose endpoints take their input's
 * encoded side (`endpoint.ts`); `procedureRoutes` is the one route table. Each namespace is
 * declared with `planningCenterGroup` or `plainGroup` (`group.ts`), so every endpoint has its
 * middleware in the same order; a namespace added here without its handlers fails when the
 * server's router is built.
