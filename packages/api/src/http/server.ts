/**
 * The product API over HttpApi: every group's handlers and both middlewares, as one layer that
 * adds the API's routes to the Worker's HttpRouter. A group without its handlers fails when the
 * router is built; a handler whose services the middlewares do not provide fails to typecheck.
 * Nothing here is per request: the server and error reporter arrive with each request
 * (`IsolateServer`).
