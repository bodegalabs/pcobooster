const questions = [
  {
    question: "Who is PCOBooster for?",
    answer:
      "Ministry leaders whose church already runs on Planning Center Services: worship leaders, team leaders and schedulers, production leads, and the pastors and staff who keep each Sunday on track. If you spend your week in Services, PCOBooster is built to make that week shorter.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does this replace Planning Center?",
    answer:
      "No. Planning Center Services stays the home for your plans, people, and songs. PCOBooster is the workspace on top of it: it reads what’s already there and writes your changes straight back, so everyone else on your team keeps using Planning Center the way they do today.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does it change in Planning Center?",
    answer:
      "Only what you change. Scheduling someone, marking a response, editing the order of service, setting a key, adjusting a time, or saving a chord chart writes to Planning Center, just as if you’d done it there. There’s nothing to import, and nothing to keep in sync.",
  },
  {
    question: "What does beta mean here?",
    answer:
      "Scheduling, team health, the run sheet, service times, and chord charts all work today and save to Planning Center. It’s still early, so expect rough edges and changes as it grows. If something breaks or feels off, the feedback button in the app’s sidebar goes straight to Jake.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this an official Planning Center product?",
    answer:
      "No. PCOBooster is independently built and operated. We use the Planning Center API, but are not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by Planning Center.",
  },
  {
    question: "What do I need to get started?",
    answer:
      "A Planning Center account with access to Services. Sign in with Planning Center and your plans are there right away. PCOBooster works within the access your account already has, so people only see and change what Planning Center lets them.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much will it cost?",
