/**
 * Wraps the product client for screens. Every call goes through the scheduler, so interactive
 * calls hold speculative work back. A call records the credentials in use when it starts; an
 * `Unauthenticated` answer is reported with them, so a late answer for an account the person has
 * already left never signs out the current one. Per-call headers pin that same snapshot over
 * the live header getter, including empty headers that remove an older credential.
 *
 * A client from `forScope` belongs to one account scope's query cache. Each of its calls, retries
 * included, checks when it actually starts (after any wait behind the scheduler) that the session
 * is still in that scope, and otherwise fails with `ScopeChangedError` without sending anything.
 *
 * Each call also sends a fresh `x-request-id`, which the API logs on its outcome line; a call
 * that fails leaves that ID, its procedure, its duration, and the diagnostics context it started
 * in with the rejection (`diagnostics/call-failures.ts`) for the query cache to report if the
 * failure is terminal.
